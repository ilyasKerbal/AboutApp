\n\nI am a JavaScript full-stack developer.
\n\nI\'ve been programming since my childhood starting with C and C++.
\n\nDuring my engineering studies at the School of Information Science, I had the chance to learn Java and Python.\n\n
\nTo view some of my awesome projects, check the section below. \n
\nI believe that programming is more than just writing code; \nIt\'s more about problem-solving and design thinking.\n
\nMy best learning technique is to reverse-engineer the best projects and learn from them step-by-step.\n\n
